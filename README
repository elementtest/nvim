README GOAL >>> give general notes on using NVIM

after you install a plugin in the plugins folder you need to install it

use :Lazy to open the lazy menu

after installed it will not be loaded load it with 

:Lazy load 

then hit tab to scroll through the various options and find the one

lazy loading will load certain parts ONLY WHEN NEEDED 

it WILL NOT load everything at once.  

setting lazy = false will make it so it loads on bootup


<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PLUGINS >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
priority means it will be loaded FIRST

each lua plugin will take an argument called config

it gets called everytime the plugin gets loaded

it can be a function or it can be a table 

TO DO :: continue josean treesitter video, set up keymaps and play around with javascript file
icons will change based on git status in file tree

ERROR:  

WARNING {nvim-tree.lua}: setting a table to `Plugin.config` is deprecated. Please use `Plugin.opts` instead

HOW TO FIX IT:: conf usually used as a table had to go in and replace 
conf with ops = { } to fix the error.  just changing one word
TO DO:: text objects in treesitter to move more quickly across code i.e. moving shortcuts for loops, moving classes, etc
